Interactive Form:

I built this project for the completion of Unit 3 of my Treehouse Techdegree assugnments.
The form checks input fields for required validation.

This project was built primarily through jQuery without any additional plugins.

What it does:
Checks validation individually for valid name, email, at least one checked box, and credit card payment info.
